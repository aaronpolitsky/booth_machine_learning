This is my formerly private repo I used to track my assignments for a machine learning class I took at UChicago Booth. 
Being from 2015, it is very much base R and not Tidyverse syntax. 

For the "final/" project, I trained a deep neural network on NOAA buoy data to predict surfable conditions in California and Hawaii based on ocean conditions off the coast of Alaska.
