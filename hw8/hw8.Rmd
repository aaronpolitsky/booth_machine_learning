# Part 1
```{r, message=FALSE}
set.seed(99)
library(igraph)
library(igraphdata)
data(karate, package = "igraphdata")

# nodes in faction 1 will be rectangles
# nodes in faction 2 will be circles
shapes = c('rectangle', 'circle')
faction_vertex_shape = get.vertex.attribute(karate, "Faction")
faction_vertex_shape[faction_vertex_shape == 1] = shapes[1]
faction_vertex_shape[faction_vertex_shape == 2] = shapes[2]

# store layout so that it does not change for different plots
if (file.exists("karate.layout.Rdata")) {
  load("karate.layout.Rdata")
} else {
  karate_layout <- layout.davidson.harel(karate)
}
```

Generate communities using a variety of algorithms:
```{r}
clustering.functions <- c(cluster_edge_betweenness,
                          cluster_fast_greedy,
                          cluster_infomap,
                          cluster_label_prop,
                          cluster_leading_eigen,
                          cluster_louvain,
                          cluster_optimal,
                          cluster_spinglass,
                          cluster_walktrap)
comms <- lapply(clustering.functions, function(cf) {cf(karate)})
```

First, examine the hierarchical communities:

```{r}
c <- comms[[1]]
cl2 <- cutat(c, no=2)
plot(karate,
     layout=karate_layout, 
     vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape,
     vertex.color=cl2
)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))
```

Edge Betweeness is hierarchical and when cut to two communities, has only two error nodes.  

```{r}
c <- comms[[2]]
cl2 <- cutat(c, no=2)
plot(karate,
     layout=karate_layout, 
     vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape,
     vertex.color=cl2
)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))
```

Fast Greedy actually gets it right.  Impressive.  

```{r}
c <- comms[[5]]
cl2 <- cutat(c, no=2)
plot(karate,
     layout=karate_layout, 
     vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape,
     vertex.color=cl2
)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))
```

Leading Eigenvector seems to want to use too many communities and complains about cutting.  


```{r}
c <- comms[[9]]
cl2 <- cutat(c, no=2)
plot(karate,
     layout=karate_layout, 
     vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape,
     vertex.color=cl2
)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))
```

Walktrap actually gets it right, too.  

And on to the non-hierarchical communities:

```{r}
c <- comms[[3]]
plot(x = c, karate, layout=karate_layout, vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))

```

Infomap does pretty well, too.  

```{r}
c <- comms[[4]]
plot(x = c, karate, layout=karate_layout, vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))

```

Label Prop splits nearly the same as Infomap, though it sub-factions the true A community. 

```{r}
c <- comms[[6]]
plot(x = c, karate, layout=karate_layout, vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))

```

Multilevel wants to sub-faction the true A community.  


```{r}
c <- comms[[7]]
plot(x = c, karate, layout=karate_layout, vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))

```

Optimal?  Not so much.  Same as Multilevel.  

```{r}
c <- comms[[8]]
plot(x = c, karate, layout=karate_layout, vertex.shape=faction_vertex_shape)
title(main=c$algorithm, sub=paste("modularity:", 
                                  formatC(modularity(karate, cl2),digits = 3)))

```

Spinglass, similar to above.  


# Part 2

```{r}
wg = read.graph("wikipedia.gml", "gml")
summary(wg)

list.vertex.attributes(wg)
get.vertex.attribute(wg, "label")[1:5]

# some algorithms work on undirected graphs only
wgu = as.undirected(wg)
summary(wgu)

# compute communities and visually inspect if they make sense
```
```{r, eval=F}
system.time(lb <- cluster_label_prop(wgu))
system.time(fg <- cluster_fast_greedy(wgu))
system.time(lv <- cluster_louvain(wgu))
system.time(wt <- cluster_walktrap(wg))  
system.time(im <- cluster_infomap(wg))
system.time(le <- cluster_leading_eigen(wg))
```
```{r, echo=F}
load("wiki.comms.Rda")
lb <- comms[[1]]
fg <- comms[[2]]
lv <- comms[[3]]
wt <- comms[[4]]
im <- comms[[5]]
le <- comms[[6]]

```

I'm omitting some methods which seem like they would take too long. 

This graph seems to be cumbersome to visually inspect:

## Analysis of vertex labels
As opposed to graphing.  

###Fast Greedy:
```{r, eval=F}
set.seed(99)
sample(get.vertex.attribute(wgu, "label")[membership(fg)==1], 15)
```
```

Yep.  Mostly.

```

Let's see how others did:

Well, I could go on, but I can see these are pretty effective from just crunching on the graphs.
